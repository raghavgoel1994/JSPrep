The difference in context handling between arrow functions and regular functions in JavaScript stems from how they treat the `this` keyword.

**Regular Functions:**

* **Dynamic `this`:**
    * The value of `this` inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on how the function is called.
    * It can vary based on the calling context.
    * For example:
        * If a function is called as a method of an object (`obj.myFunction()`), `this` refers to the object (`obj`).
        * If a function is called as a standalone function (`myFunction()`), `this` might refer to the global object (in non-strict mode) or be `undefined` (in strict mode).
        * If a function is used as a constructor (`new myFunction()`), `this` refers to the newly created object.
        * Inside of a setTimeout call, this will refer to the global object, or undefined in strict mode.
* **`apply`, `call`, and `bind`:**
    * Regular functions have methods like `apply`, `call`, and `bind` that allow you to explicitly set the `this` value.

**Arrow Functions:**

* **Lexical `this`:**
    * Arrow functions do *not* have their own `this` context.
    * Instead, they inherit the `this` value from their enclosing lexical scope (the scope in which they are defined).
    * This means that `this` inside an arrow function always refers to the `this` value of the surrounding code.
* **No `apply`, `call`, or `bind` (Effectively):**
    * While you can technically use `apply`, `call`, or `bind` with arrow functions, they won't change the `this` value. The `this` value will still be determined by the lexical scope.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

* **Dynamic vs. Lexical:**
    * Regular functions have a dynamic `this`, while arrow functions have a lexical `this`.
* **Context Determination:**
    * The `this` value in regular functions depends on how they are called.
    * The `this` value in arrow functions is determined by their surrounding lexical scope.
* **Context Manipulation:**
    * Regular functions allow you to explicitly set the `this` value using `apply`, `call`, or `bind`.
    * Arrow functions do not allow you to change their `this` value.

**Why the Difference?**

* Arrow functions were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to provide a more concise syntax and to address common `this` context issues that developers often encountered with regular functions.
* The lexical `this` behavior of arrow functions makes them particularly useful for callbacks and other scenarios where you want to preserve the `this` value of the enclosing scope.

**Example:**

```javascript
function RegularFunction() {
  this.value = 'regular';

  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(this.value); // 'this' might be undefined or the global object
  }, 100);
}

function ArrowFunction() {
  this.value = 'arrow';

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(this.value); // 'this' refers to the ArrowFunction instance
  }, 100);
}

new RegularFunction(); // Output: undefined (or error in strict mode)
new ArrowFunction(); // Output: arrow
```

In this example, the arrow function correctly preserves the `this` context of the `ArrowFunction` instance, while the regular function loses the context.
